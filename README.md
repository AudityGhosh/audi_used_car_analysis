# Goal of this project:
#### 1) To know about the plots that help to visualize the dataset.
#### 2) Extracting the insights of each variable through data visualization.
#### 3) Applying various machine learning models on the dataset and predict target variable.
#### 4) Computing Key Performance Indicators of the model

###### Attached notebook includes barplot, piechart, scatter plot, regression plot, pair plot, box plot , violinplot and histogram using the attributes of the dataset. 
###### I have applied Linear Regression on the dataset.
