# Goal of this project:
#### 1) To know about the plots that help to visualize the dataset.
#### 2) Extracting the insights of each variable through data visualization.
#### 3) Applying various machine learning models on the dataset and predict target variable.
#### 4) Computing Key Performance Indicators of the model
#### 5) Visualizing Prediction Error of the model

###### Attached notebook includes barplot, piechart, scatter plot, regression plot, pair plot, box plot , violinplot and histogram using the attributes of the dataset. 
###### I have applied Linear Regression on the dataset. 


#### The dataset was collected from   https://github.com/SKawsar/Data_Visualization_with_Python/blob/main/audi.csv
#### The actual dataset source was https://www.kaggle.com/aishwaryamuthukumar/cars-dataset-audi-bmw-ford-hyundai-skoda-vw
